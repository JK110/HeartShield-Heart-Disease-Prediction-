    <h1>About Our Model and Heart Health</h1>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Common Heart-Related Problems</h2>
        <p>Cardiovascular disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coronary Artery Disease:</strong> Damaged or diseased major blood vessels.</li>
            <li><strong>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):</strong> The force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrhythmia:</strong> An irregular heartbeat, either too fast, too slow, or erratic.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Failure:</strong> The heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>How This Model Can Help</h2>
        <p>This tool uses an <strong>AI</strong> machine learning model. It was trained on a large, anonymized dataset containing thousands of patient records, each with 11 health metrics (like age, blood pressure, cholesterol) and a known outcome (presence or absence of heart disease).</p>
        <p>By analyzing your data, the model identifies complex patterns that are associated with higher risk. It provides a probability score, giving you an indication of potential risk based on the data it learned from. This is not a diagnosis, but a powerful tool for early warning and discussion.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Preventions and Healthy Activities</h2>
        <p>You can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease by adopting a healthier lifestyle:</p>
        <div class="info-cards">
            <div class="card diet">
                <h3>Eat a Healthy Diet</h3>
                <p>Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce intake of saturated fats, trans fats, sodium, and added sugars.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card active">
                <h3>Stay Active</h3>
                <p>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card stress">
                <h3>Manage Stress</h3>
                <p>Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as meditation, yoga, or spending time on hobbies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card smoke">
                <h3>Don't Smoke</h3>
                <p>Smoking is one of the most significant risk factors. Quitting can dramatically lower your risk.</p>
